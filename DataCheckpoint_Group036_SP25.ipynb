        "As e-commerce is becoming more of an important part of our everyday lives with us buying things from clothes to even food through online shopping, it is important for businesses to track these purchases and predict a customer's next purchase. By using the customer age, gender, and location along with common seasonal purchasing behaviors companies would be able to prepare to aid the customer needs. This would lead to greater customer satisfaction and loyalty as companies would be selling goods of greater importance to the customers. This would also aid companies in inventory management, marketing strategies and much more. Overall, being able to predict customers next purchase is important for customer satisfaction and building a business.\n",

        "Previous research has explored various ways to predict consumer behavior based on transactional history and demographic attributes. In a research paper called 'Predicting the Category of Customers’ Next Product to Buy in Web Shops' the researchers were able to develop a Sequential Event Prediction (SEP) model to predict the  next product category a customer will purchase as a webshop. Their model used general and also cusomter-specific purchasing behaviors and information to improve customer purchase predictions. The model with individual information and behaviors yielded an accuracy of 47.7%, the one with general information, 50.3%, and the mixed model, 50.7% <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360448047_Predicting_the_category_of_customers'_next_product_to_buy_in_web_shops).

        "We hypothesize that a customer's next clothing purchase category can be accurately predicted using seasonal and demographic information. Specifically, we expect that younger customers will illustrate stronger seasonal variation in their clothing purchases. For example, buying more summer apparel during warmer months, while older customers may present more consistent purchasing patterns across seasons. We believe this because due to social media being a huge part of the younger generations lives, they are more susceptible to social media influence (for example summer/winter outfits on media such as instagram or tiktok) thus leading to stronger seasonal variations in clothes purchases."

        "There are several privacy and ethical concerns that our project may face when predicting the next clothing purchase categories of customers. Initially, we have customer demographic information (age, gender, location) in our dataset, which raises privacy concerns. Even though the data appears to be anonymous, we have to make sure there is no personally identifiable information that can be acquired during analysis or in our final results. Additionally, we will not attempt any re-identification of individuals and will present only general patterns. Furthermore, bias is another problem/concern we many face. The data set can be unrepresentative of all customer groups, especially if it skews toward particular groups (e.g., younger users, some geographic locations, or predominantly online shoppers). If the training data set under-represents some groups, it can lead to unjust/biased results. For instance, fashion trends may vary drastically by culture and geography and, if improperly represented, the model will make inaccurate predictions for them. To address such issues, we will inspect the distribution of the dataset along key demographic axes before constructing models, looking for skew (e.g., drastically more young customers than elderly ones). If there are extreme imbalances, we will consider techniques like stratified sampling, weighting, or reporting results separately across different subgroups. During analysis, we will monitor model performance for differences between demographic slices to detect biased results. After analysis is finished, we will openly report any biases or data limitations that may impact generalization. Throughout the project, we will maintain a strong focus on not infringing on user privacy, and ensuring that no outputs would be capable of harming or misleading individuals or groups.\n"
